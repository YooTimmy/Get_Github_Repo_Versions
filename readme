##Python version: 3.6.6
##Packages Used: requests, json, re

##How to use:
In the command line, cd to the folder level of get_version.py, type in "python get_version.py"

##Explaination:

Part 1:

Since it is requested to retrieve the version IDs from github links, it is worth to explore the github API first to see if there are any available
APIs to use. After some exploration, I observed that github APIs like 'https://api.github.com/repos/xx/xx/tags' would return the version
IDs nicely in json format.
One additional effort for pre-processing part is for tensorflow API. Somehow it return several additional lines before the
actual version IDs. I used regular expressions to filter out those lines when forming the final version list for it.

Part 2:
To remove the 'v' in front of numbers, I used regular expression to identify those strings start with 'v' and simple return the part of strings after 'c'. After this, I think the version ID formats across 3 repos are more or less similar.
